# IR-Code-Referencer
This repo contains the code that was written in my video about using and IR sensor in python. Please find a link to this video below to learn more about the subject. This code is a simple application to cross refernce incomming codes with stored ones; you can find some software to read the codes in the first place at https://github.com/Lime-Parallelogram/IR-Code-Decoder-- or write it yourself based on this code.

Good Luck!
